# Future Plans & Improvements

This document outlines potential future directions, feature enhancements, and refactoring opportunities for the Ultimate-AI project.

## Core Functionality

*   **Database Enhancements:**
    *   Implement migrations for database schema changes.
    *   Add more robust error handling and logging for database operations.
    *   Consider alternative database backends if performance or scalability become concerns.
*   **Plugin System:**
    *   Develop a more formal plugin architecture for easier integration of new tools (beyond Selenium).
    *   Document the plugin API.
    *   Add examples of different plugin types.

## Navigator Component (`navigator/`)

*   **Model Integration (Ref: `plan.md`):**
    *   Implement the multi-model architecture outlined in `plan.md`.
    *   Develop the suggested modules: `code_assistant.py`, `planner.py`, `semantic_indexer.py`, `api_reverse_engineer.py`.
    *   Refine the orchestration logic in `orchestrator.py`.
*   **Web Navigation (`web_navigator.py`):**
    *   Improve robustness of element identification and interaction.
    *   Add support for handling dynamic content, SPAs, and complex JavaScript interactions.
    *   Explore alternative browser automation tools (e.g., Playwright) alongside or instead of Selenium.
    *   Enhance error handling and recovery mechanisms during navigation.
*   **Memory (`navigator/memory/`):**
    *   Implement the semantic indexing and retrieval system using `mxbai-embed-large-v1`.
    *   Design and implement data structures for storing past interactions, DOM snapshots, etc.
*   **Brain (`navigator/brain/`):**
    *   Implement the core reasoning and planning logic using Hermes-3 and DeepSeek-R1.
    *   Develop strategies for handling different types of user requests.
    *   Integrate code generation capabilities using Granite-Code.

## Selenium Manager (`core/plugins/selenium_manager.py`)

*   **Cross-Browser Support:**
    *   Add support for Firefox (geckodriver) and Edge (msedgedriver).
    *   Refactor driver creation logic to handle different browser types cleanly.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Improve error reporting during driver initialization and operation.
    *   Implement more specific exception handling.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Allow passing more configuration options to the WebDriver (e.g., proxy settings, user agent).
    *   Consider loading configuration from a file or environment variables.
*   **Mock Driver:**
    *   Enhance the mock driver to simulate more complex scenarios and interactions.
    *   Make the mock driver's behavior configurable for different testing needs.

## Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Implement comprehensive unit tests for core components, database logic, and plugins.
*   **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests for the navigator orchestrator and end-to-end web navigation scenarios.
*   **CI/CD:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment.

## Documentation

*   **API Documentation:** Generate API documentation for core modules and classes.
*   **User Guide:** Create a guide on how to use the system, configure plugins, and run navigations.
*   **Developer Guide:** Document the architecture, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.

## Miscellaneous

*   **User Interface:** Consider adding a simple web UI or CLI for interacting with the system.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Profile and optimize critical code paths, especially in web navigation and AI model interactions.
*   **Security:** Review and harden security aspects, especially around browser automation and handling sensitive data.
